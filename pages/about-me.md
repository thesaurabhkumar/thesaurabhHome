## Introduction
Hi, My name is Saurabh Kumar, currently working on Compiler Development @ Ericsson. I recently finished my Master's in Computer Science from Texas A&M University. Prior to this, I worked for 4.5 years as Software Developer in leading multinational product companies where I was responsible for development of an entire product as Lead Developer due my technical and leadership prowess. I have an overall professional work experience of 4.5 years in Software Design & Development. During my tenure, I worked on highly complex software using state of the art technologies, best programming practices, design patterns and software development methodologies. I have an innate passion for research and constantly thrive to innovate and solve problems efficiently.  Before that, I cleared Joint Entrance Examination and was fortunate to get admission into an IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) to study Computer Science where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering.

During my Masters, I served as a Teaching Assistant for the Department of Computer Science for the past 2 semesters where I taught C++ to undergraduate students. I was the only Master's student to be offered this position twice consecutively due to my excellent performance. I also developed an Autograding software to grade students programming assignments automatically which helped in providing prompt feedback and grades to the students and reduced the manual grading overhead on instructors.

When I am not on the job, I like to listen to music and sip coffee. I am a fitness fanatic and love to work out as it keeps me healthy and tremendously improves my productivity. I also like to try out new recipes every once in a while, for my fiancée. I like art and music and can perform a solo on an acoustic guitar. Bill Gates once said that "Software is a great combination between artistry and engineering" and I second that. I like programming and enjoy various aspects of Software Design and Development.

Through social service, I want to create an impact on the society through education. I believe that a more educated society will make the world a better place. I am a member of the Indian Red Cross Society and have volunteered multiple times for donation drives and relief work after natural disasters. I also volunteered as a tutor as member of a Nonprofit organization called Kashi Utkarsh during my bachelors. Currently, I want to focus on my career goals and improve my skills to achieve professional excellence which I plan to use to make a positive impact on the society in future. You can go through my profile to know more about me. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to say hello.
