## Hiring Activities
I have been involved with several recruitment processes and hiring events during my professional experience. I enjoy talking to candidates and facilitating technical interviews. I also represented Ericsson at the engineering career fairs at Texas A&M University for the past 2 years.

## Volunteer & Social Activities
I participate in social causes whenever possible. Here in Austin, I have volunteered at the Central Texas Food Bank multiple times. I try to give back within my means in various areas, but in the long term, I want to create an impact on the society through education. I believe that a more educated society will make the world a better place. I am a member of the Indian Red Cross Society and have volunteered for donation drives and relief work during natural disasters. I also volunteered as a tutor in a Nonprofit organization named Kashi Utkarsh during my undergraduate.

## Conferences & Seminars
I really enjoy attending technical conferences & seminars. Its the perfect way to learn and network with like minded professionals. Most recently, I attended the LLVM foundation developers conference in 2019 at San Jose, CA on behalf of Ericsson. It was really motivating to meet some of the most influential compiler developers from all over the world.

## Travel
I like to travel and explore new places with my partner during our vacations. We most recently traveled to Colorado and it was beautful. I love to hike and try local cuisines during my trips. One of my hobbies is photography and I take lots of pictures everywhere.
