## Introduction <i class="fa fa-user fa-1x"></i>
Hi, <br>
My name is Saurabh Kumar and I currently work as a Senior Compiler Engineer @ Ericsson Inc. I possess over 7 years of professional experience as a software developer in leading multinational product companies. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from Texas A&M University(College Station) and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT).

In my current role, I am focused on the development & extension of LLVM infrastructure to build tools and software for the improvement of high-performance DSP firmware. I am currently working on the development & extension of UBSan to support full runtime dynamic analysis in memory constrained embedded environments within the 5G domain. My prior work includes conceptualization of several static analysis checkers to automatically identify and correct bug prone C code in the firmware, feature extensions & integration of CodeChecker to facilitate static and dynamic analysis of entire C source code at Ericsson and development as well as deployment of a tool to automatically format C source code according to Ericsson coding guidelines in order to incorporate best coding practices and reduce errors.

 Prior to my current role, I worked for 4.5 years as a Software Developer primarily in compiler technologies within the EDA domain. I worked as a Lead Developer at Mentor, A Siemens Business where I worked as a product owner establishing my technical and leadership prowess. During my professional journey, I worked on highly complex software using state of the art technologies, best programming practices, design patterns and software development methodologies. I have an innate passion for research and constantly thrive to innovate and solve problems efficiently. Before starting my professional career, I cleared the prestigious Joint Entrance Examination and was fortunate to get admission into an IIT (Indian Institute of Technology) to study Computer Science where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering.

During my Masters, I served as a Teaching Assistant for the Department of Computer Science for 2 semesters where I taught C++ to undergraduate students. I was the only Master's student to be offered this position twice consecutively due to my excellent performance and knowledge. I also developed an Autograding software to grade the programming assignments of students automatically which helped in providing prompt feedback and grades to the students and reduced the manual grading overhead on instructors.

When I am not on the job, I like to listen to music and sip coffee. I am a fitness fanatic and love to work out as it keeps me healthy and tremendously improves my productivity. I also like to cook and try out new recipes every once in a while for my fiancée.

Lastly, I participate in social causes whenever possible. I have volunteered at the Central Texas Food Bank multiple times and believe in giving back. In the long term, I want to create an impact on the society through education. I believe that a more educated society will make the world a better place. I am a member of the Indian Red Cross Society and have volunteered multiple times for donation drives and relief work after natural disasters. I also volunteered as a tutor as member of a Nonprofit organization called Kashi Utkarsh during my bachelors. Currently, I want to focus on my career goals and improve my skills to achieve professional excellence which I plan to use to make a positive impact on the society in future. You can go through my profile to know more about me. If you'd like to get in touch, feel free to say hello.
