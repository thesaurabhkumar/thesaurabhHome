## DESCRIPTION

The objective of this project was that given a semantic layout of a scene, we want to generate a photorealistic image of a scene that conforms to the input layout. The generated image was realistic in appearance compared to the real-world scenes.

## Example

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

Python, Pytorch, CUDA, csh scripting

## TOOLS USED

Google Colab, Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services, Cityscapes dataset & NYU indoor scene dataset
