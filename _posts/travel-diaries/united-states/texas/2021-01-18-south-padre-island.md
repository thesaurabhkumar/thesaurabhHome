## General Tips
1. Make sure to carry your passport & other valid identification. There is a border security checkpoint roughly an hour before entering South Padre Island. The check happens while returning from South Padre Island & not while entering it. If you are a tourist or on another type of visa, please make sure to carry immigration related documents too.
2. Some food trucks in South Padre Islands only accept cash. So carrying a few dollars in cash is usually recommended
3. If you are travelling from Austin or surrounding region, you usually need to stop for gas once each way. Please plan accordingly.
