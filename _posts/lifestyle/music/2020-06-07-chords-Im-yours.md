[Verse]
     G
Well you done done me and you bet I felt it,
   D
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted,
  Em
I fell right through the cracks,
C
And now I'm tryin to get back...
 
            G
Before the cool done run out, I'll be givin it my bestest
    D
and Nothin's gonna stop me but divine intervention
    Em
I reckon it's again my turn,
    C           D
To Win some or learn some....
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G              D
But I wont hesitate
            Em
No more, No more
            C              G   D   Em   C
It can not wait; I'm yours
 
 
[Verse]
 
G                                    D
Well, open up your mind and see like me,
                                    Em
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
                                      C
Look into your heart and you'll find love, love, love, love.

G                                                      D  
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing, 
                    Em 
we're just one big family
                                       C                            A7
And it's our god-forsaken right to be loved, loved, loved, loved, loved.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G              D
So I won't hesitate
             Em
No more, no more
           C
It cannot wait,
I'm sure
 
G                      D
There's no need to complicate
             Em
Our time is short
            C             
This is our fate,
         G 
I'm yours
 
 
[Bridge]
 
G                      Bm 
Doo do do doo doo do, doo do doo do doo do
Em                     D                C
Do you want to come on, scooch on over closer, dear
                       A7
And I will nibble your ear
G Bm Em D C A7
 
 
[Verse]
 
                   G                       
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
      D                      
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
     Em
But my breath fogged up the glass
       C
And so I drew a new face and I laughed.
        G                          
I guess what I'll be saying is there ain't no better reason
   D                         
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons.
  Em
It's what we aim to do.
    C
Our name is our virtue.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G              D
But I won't hesitate
            Em
No more, No more
            C              G  
It can not wait; I'm yours
 

[Outro]
 
G                                    D
Well, open up your mind and see like me,
                                    Em
Open up your plans and damn you're free.
                                      C
Look into your heart and you'll find that the sky is yours.
   G
So please don't, please don't, please don't...
        D
There's no need to complicate.
           Em
'Cause our time is short.
                             C
This oh, this oh, this is our fate.
           A7
I'm yours
